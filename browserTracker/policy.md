# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 26, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the **“btr”** Chrome Extension (the “Extension”) collects, uses, and handles user data.

## 1. Data Collection

The Extension collects **technical and functional data only as required for debugging and core functionality**.

The Extension may access:
- browser tabs (URL and tab state);
- cookies associated with the active tab;
- network request metadata via Chrome `webRequest` and `webRequestBlocking` APIs.

The Extension **does not collect personal user information**, such as:
- names, email addresses, or phone numbers;
- login credentials or passwords;
- payment or financial information.

## 2. Local Data Transmission (Debug Mode)

For development and debugging purposes, the Extension may send collected technical data **exclusively to a local server running on the user’s own machine**, including:

- `http://localhost`
- `http://127.0.0.1`

This data transmission:
- occurs **only within the local device**;
- is **not transmitted to remote or external servers**;
- is used solely for debugging, development, or diagnostic purposes.

No data is transmitted to servers owned or operated by the developer or by any third party.

## 3. Data Usage

Collected data is used strictly to:
- enable debugging and development workflows;
- provide the core functionality of the Extension;
- inspect and analyze browser behavior locally.

The Extension does **not** use data for:
- advertising or marketing;
- analytics or tracking;
- user profiling.

## 4. Data Storage

The Extension may store limited technical data locally using the Chrome `storage` API.

This data:
- remains on the user’s device;
- is not synchronized with external servers;
- can be removed by uninstalling the Extension or clearing browser storage.

## 5. Data Sharing

The Extension **does not share user data with third parties**.

Specifically, no data is shared with:
- advertising networks;
- analytics services;
- external APIs;
- governmental or commercial entities.

## 6. Network Permissions

The Extension requests access to all URLs (`http://*/*`, `https://*/*`) solely to observe and debug network requests initiated by the user’s browser.

This access:
- is limited to inspection and optional blocking functionality;
- does not involve transmitting data to external endpoints;
- is used only in accordance with the Extension’s described functionality.

## 7. Security

All data processing occurs locally within the browser or on the user’s own machine. Reasonable technical measures are applied to prevent unintended data exposure.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will always be available via the link provided in the Chrome Web Store listing.
